Document issues and improvements below:

## Issues & Recommendations

- [ ] Consider adding ARIA live regions for dynamic error/success messages for even better screen reader support.
- [ ] Add more visual focus indicators for keyboard users (e.g., custom focus ring on buttons/inputs).
- [ ] Ensure all form fields have associated labels and helper text is programmatically associated (aria-describedby).
- [ ] Add a skip-to-content link for improved accessibility on long forms.
- [ ] Test on additional devices/browsers for edge-case layout issues.

Overall, the registration flow is robust, accessible, and user-friendly. Minor improvements above are recommended for best-in-class accessibility and polish.
